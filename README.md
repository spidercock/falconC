# FalconC

FalconC is an advanced superset of C designed to enhance safety, readability, and functionality in systems programming. It builds upon the foundations of C while incorporating several modern features to improve development efficiency and code quality.

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: 
  - Provides compile-time errors to prevent common issues such as memory leaks and dangling references.
  
- **Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching**: 
  - Offers advanced data types and pattern matching for better error handling and more expressive code.
  
- **Generics and Type Classes**: 
  - Supports generics and type classes similar to Rust traits, enabling flexible and reusable code components.
  
- **Enhanced Syntax**: 
  - Features a more intuitive and readable syntax compared to traditional C.
  
- **Namespaces and Scopes**: 
  - Adds support for namespaces and scope management to better organize and modularize code.
  
- **Segmentation Fault Prevention**: 
  - Includes mechanisms to prevent segmentation faults and enhance program stability.
  
- **Standard Collections**: 
  - Provides a set of ready-to-use standard collections for common data structures and algorithms.
  
- **Interpreter and Tools**: 
  - Comes with an interpreter, project manager, unit tester, and coverage checker to streamline development and testing processes.

## Warning

- FalconC is not object-oriented and does not include classes. It uses a similar syntax to C to improve readability without adopting OOP principles.

## Goals

- Minimize runtime errors through rigorous compile-time checks. This approach may lead to longer compile times but results in more robust and error-free code.
